# jekyll-open-sdg-plugins

> ðŸ’Ž Jekyll plugins for use with the Open SDG platform

This plugin provides some Jekyll functionality for the [Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) platform.

The functionality provided consists of:

## 1. A "t" Liquid filter for translating strings.

Usage example:

```
{{ my_variable | t }}
```

## 2. Fill in missing fields to allow partially translated metadata.

This allows metadata to be translated, field-by-field as needed, in subfolders in the data repository.

## 3. Automatically create goal pages based on data.

This creates goal pages automatically based on the data, so that the site repository does not need to maintain a `_goals` folder. It depends on a `_config.yml` setting.

Usage example (in `_config.yml`):
```
create_goals:
  # This determines which layout is used to render the pages.
  layout: goal
```

## 4. Automatically create indicator pages based on data.

This creates indicator pages automatically based on the data, so that the site repository does not need to maintain a `_indicators` folder. It depends on a `_config.yml` setting.

Usage example (in `_config.yml`):
```
create_indicators:
  # This determines which layout is used to render the pages.
  layout: indicator
```

## 5. Automatically create 4 required pages.

This automates the creation of 4 required pages that all implementations of Open SDG will need. These consist of:

* the home page: /
* the indicators json page: /indicators.json
* the search results page: /search
* the reporting status page: /reporting-status

There are advanced options for overriding the location of these pages (see creae_pages.rb). But see the example below to use the defaults.

Usage example (in `_config.yml`):
```
create_pages: true
```

## 6. Automatically fetch remote data and translations.

This automates the fetching of the remote data (from the "data repository") and any remote translations.

Note: This feature is disabled if "jekyll_get_json" is in the site config. This was the older (more verbose) way to do this.

Usage example (in `_config.yml`):
```
remote_data_prefix: https://mygithuborg.github.io/my-data-repository
remote_translations:
  - https://open-sdg.github.io/sdg-translations/translations-0.6.0.json

```

For those interested in switching to this convenience feature, note that this makes the "jekyll_get_json" and "remotedatabaseurl" settings obsolete; so they can be removed.

## 7. Provide standard variables on all pages, for use in templates

This feature provides access to Hashes for goals, targets, and indicators. Each
contains the following keys:
* number (eg, "1" for a goal, "1.1" for a target, "1.1.1" for an indicator)
* name (the fully-translated name of the goal/target/indicator
* sort (a string suitable for use in sorting the goals/targets/indicators)

Additionally, Hashes for indicators contain all the indicator's metadata.

The following variables can be used on all pages:

* page.sdg_global_goals : Array of global goals
* page.sdg_global_targets : Array of global targets
* page.sdg_global_indicators : Array of global indicators
* page.sdg_available_goals : Array of available goals
* page.sdg_available_targets : Array of available targets
* page.sdg_available_indicators : Array of available indicators

The following variables can be used on all indicator pages:

* page.sdg_global_goal : the current global goal
* page.sdg_global_target : the current global target
* page.sdg_global_indicator : the current global indicator
* page.sdg_available_goal : the current available goal
* page.sdg_available_target : the current available target
* page.sdg_available_indicator : the current available indicator

The following variables can be used on all goal pages:

* page.sdg_global_goal : the current global goal
* page.sdg_available_goal : the current available goal

Examples of usage:

Printing titles for all available indicators in Goal 2:
```
{% assign indicators = page.sdg_available_indicators | where: "number", "2" %}
{% for goal in indicators %}
  {{ goal.name }}
{% endfor %}
```
